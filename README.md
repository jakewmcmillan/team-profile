# team-profile

This project was designed to assist a manager in creating a detailed roster for their team of employees.  This application could be useful for organizing any kind of group along with keeping track of important information for those individuals.  

This project was interested because it involved so many individual moving parts.  It was our introduction to tests but we had to get to a point where we could create something to be tested almost entirely from the command line.  This was by far our most files and folders for any project and exporting and requiring them carefully was neccessary.  

Below you will find a link to a video showing the application at work along with links to my GitHub.
